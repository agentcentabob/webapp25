# disclaimer
for this assessment task, i used a range of resources including the provided materials, prior knowledge, online tutorials and forums and ai. these sites helped me learn new concepts (particularly the programming langauges), understand the provided materials and develop key elements of my site.

throughout term 3, i completely avoided using artificial intelligence as i wanted to develop it from scratch and learn the accompanying skills. unlike during the term 1 assessment, i did not waste my time during class yet i was still unable to complete the work in the time provided. when the holidays came around and i found myself behind, it was clear to me that i would not finish the assessment to my standard without some use of ai to explain concepts and speed up the tedious processes. i ended up spending countless hours working on the project trying to make a project that i was really happy with, which was mostly comprised of implementing features and designing the site.

i used ai for a range of different assistive processes like debugging complex errors, explaining and implementing best practices and understanding javascript and python. claude ai clearly explained to me the process of the website development, particularly when it came to including interactivity with js and functionality with python. it was also useful in the process of improving syntax and reducing redundancies, which was especially appreciated when cleaning my  long python files. generative ai was especially crucial to the articles feature, as i used the latest gpt-5 model to generate the articles, and claude ai to prepare the prompts, verify the texts and insert them into my database correctly. it was also helpful for drafting the display text on the home and about pages, such as the explainer section at the end. i ensured that throughout the process, my work was up to my standard and that i didn't blindly use the ai's creation. 

throughout this project, i prioritised my learning and making a project that i'm actually proud of. i deliberately chose to create a web application that i would be personally satisfied with. despite the extended time required to complete the project, i really enjoyed the design process and i'm genuinely happy with the outcome.
