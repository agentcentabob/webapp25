### second design
the wireframes for the alternative were design created on figma, attached below. this design incorporated similar core elements to the initial wireframes, however included modified layouts and interactions in elements.

#### data flow
the majority of the user data flow occurs through the header. each of the key headings link to other pages, and the expanded header allows for more detailed user movements. the home page includes a number of links to other pages including types of new notes, recent notes and featured articles.
